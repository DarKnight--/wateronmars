Water On Mars!
==============

*Where good old rivers (of news) have been discovered (again).*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/wateronmars.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/wateronmars)

This project intends to provide a free (as in freedom) alternative to
web news readers and bookmark collection apps.

As such Water On Mars intends to be a news reading platform built around the following analogies:

> The user can contemplate the river of news flowing down from her selection of sources.

> If she wants she can use a sieve to filter out the most interesting pebbles (and among them maybe also some gold nuggets ?) to put them in her collection.

An demo website is up and running thanks to Heroku at: http://wateronmars-demo.herokuapp.com.

For the adventurous developers the aim is also to provide the base
boilerplate mechanics for news and bookmarks manipulation in order to
implement and experiment new features around this (now admitedly
old-fashioned) theme.
