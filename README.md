Water On Mars!
==============

*Where good old rivers (of news) have been discovered (again).*

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/wateronmars.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tibonihoo/wateronmars)

This project intends to provide a free (as in freedom) alternative to
web news readers and bookmark collection apps.

As such Water On Mars intends to be a news reading platform built around the following analogies:

> You contemplate the river of news flowing down from yur selection of sources.

> You can then use a sieve to filter out the most interesting links and collect them.

An demo website is up and running thanks to Heroku at: http://wateronmars-demo.herokuapp.com.

Feature list:

- Read news from web feeds
- List your collection of bookmarks
- Bookmarklets let you add bookmarks and feeds
- A tablet-friendly carousel view let you swipe among the news
- A mailbox-view (plus keyboard shortcut) let you browse the news efficiently
- Import bookmarks from Netscape-style bookmark list (as exported by delicious.com)
- Import subscription from OPML file (as exported by most feed readers)


For the curious developers the aim is also to provide the base
mechanics for news and bookmarks manipulation. For instance, there is
now a "good enough" database scheme, a RESTful API and a "not too
ridiculous" UX.

Everything is set up to start experimenting new features around the
admitedly old-fashioned theme of news feeds and bookmarks !
